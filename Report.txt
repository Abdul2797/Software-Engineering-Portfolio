DVD Rental Business Report 

 

Business Report 

This business report focuses on identifying the most frequent DVD renters and analyzing their rental behavior for email marketing campaigns. The goal of this report is to provide the marketing team with two easy to understand tables that enable the team to engage with customers by providing new release notifications or even rewards programs, which will further enhance sales and customer satisfaction.

Field Transformation 

The full_name field in the summary table is created by concatenating first_name and last_name. This creates a single, easy to read field, useful for marketing campaigns, where a personal greeting improves the overall customer experience. 

Business Uses 

Detailed Table: 

The detailed table provides a record of all rentals for each customer, which enables the marketing team to divide customers by rental behavior, or specific titles rented. Another benefit of the detailed table is that it's useful for analyzing the effectiveness of the promotions themselves. 

Summary Table: 

The summary table shows the top customers by their rental count. This supports email marketing campaigns by identifying frequent customers who would likely be more receptive to promotions.

Report Refresh Frequency 

The report should be refreshed daily using pgAgent made for PostgreSQL (Redwood Software, n.d.) to remain relevant for marketing campaigns. Daily updates would ensure that the marketing team has a current list of frequent renters, increasing the campaign's effectiveness.
